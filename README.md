# Fun-with-Gifs

This repository was initally made as part of a coding bootcamp course I did through the University  of New Hampshire to make a gif searching up using an external API and then using jQuery to render the gifs with bootstrap and HTML.

I have decideded to abandon that project and instead use REACT to do the same thing for more practice using that framework.
